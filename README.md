# ML-PDF-Text-Summary

This is my work for TOHacks 2021 Hackathon. Our project, EduLogical, aims to provide a better studying tool for students by summarizing long papers into the salient points.
There would be a multiple-choice quiz functionality based on the summarized text as well as fill-in-the-blanks. 

For my part, I wrote this code to convert PDF inputs into text, and then summarize the text using 3 different options: OpenAI API, HuggingFace Bart-Large API, or HuggingFace Bart-Large locally run CNN.
